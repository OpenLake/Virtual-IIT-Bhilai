<h1 align="center">The Virtual IIT Bhilai project 🏨</h1>


## 🤔 Problem
COVID-19 seperated IIT Bhilai students and now they can't enjoy campus life. We can't bring people physically together without avoiding the possibility of covid spreading among students. But what about a virtual approach ? This project will make it possible to virtually walk around the campus.
